Easily add your Meta Tags to the WordPress website's head section. This is a must have tool for authors and website owners.


== Description ==
An easy to use, with intuitive interface WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily add your Meta Tags to the head section of your website.

No need anymore to editing a files of your theme or plugins in order to add meta tags. You can add they on plugins settings page. Just add your ID (the meta key "content" value from your verification code) or/and the URL to the social media profile of the publisher in the field on the plugin settings page and this plugin will do the rest for you. It adds required meta tags to the head section of your website automatically, without changing any of your themes file and without slowing down your website. It's really useful in case of any theme update, because your meta tags would never be lost! Your meta tags will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

Third-party services like Google Webmaster Tools, Alexa, Pinterest and Google+ require you to verify your domain. This makes sure that you are the correct owner of your blog or store before they provide their services to you. You can use this plugin to easily verify your website or domain and get a more effective and efficient sharing results. Example with Pinterest. Once you completed the verification process, people will see a checkmark next to your domain in your Pinterest profile and in pinner search results. That check mark emphasis you have confirmed the ownership of your blog or website on Pinterest. This will help your website to rank better in google and other search engines. You can easily increase your blog traffic using this plugin. "All Meta Tags" is a simple but effective SEO plugin.

Also you can use this plugin to add required meta tags such as Author, Designer, Contact, Copyright and Keywords in everywhere on your website (It adds the required meta tags to the header of all pages on your website) or the meta Description and Keywords only for Static Home Page or the meta Description and Keywords only for Blog Page.

If you want more options then tell me and I will be happy to add it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, fill in the required fields, select the desired settings and click the "Save Changes" button. Enjoy the improved SEO of your website. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WP Admin Panel`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`All Meta Tags`".

= Q. How much of description I can enter in the text field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters, but most search engines use a maximum of 160 chars for the home description.

= Q. How much of keywords I can enter in the text field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. I can't get verify my website. What am I doing wrong? =
A. The tag code which Google (or Bing, Yandex, Pinterest, Alexa, Norton, WOT, SpecificFeeds) gives you is confusing as you only have to paste in the serial key number/letters (`1234567890`) and not the whole tag (`<meta name="google-site-verification" content=“1234567890” />`). So just paste that into the relevant field and you will see “Success” message appear within a few seconds.

= Q. What about compatibility with the "All in One SEO Pack" plugin ? =
A. To make these plugins compatible you need to stick to one simple rule: do not fill the same field in both plugins at once. Otherwise both plugins fulfill their work and you will get a duplicate actions, for example:
`<head>
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright (c) 2013-2017 Arthur Gareginyan. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2017 Arthur Gareginyan. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
</head>`

In the rest, the "All Meta Tags" and "All in One SEO Pack" is compatible.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Panel of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Please visit the [Dedicated Plugin Page on GitHub](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/all-meta-tags) and report.

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
A. Any suggestions are very welcome! Please send me an email to [arthurgareginyan@gmail.com](mailto:arthurgareginyan@gmail.com). Thank you!

= Q. I love this plugin! Can I help somehow? =
A. Yes, any financial contributions are welcome! Just visit [my website](http://www.arthurgareginyan.com/donate.html), click on the donate button, and thank you!
