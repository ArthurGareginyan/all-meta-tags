== Description ==
An easy to use and lightweight WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily add your Meta Tags to the head section of your website. 

No need anymore to editing a files of your theme or plugins in order to add meta tags. You can add they on plugins settings page. Just add your ID (the meta key "content" value from your verification code) or/and the URL to the social media profile of the publisher in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you. It adds required meta tags to the head section of your website automatically, without changing any of your themes file and without slowing down your website. It's really useful in case of any theme update, because your meta tags would never be lost! Your meta tags will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

Third-party services like Google Webmaster Tools, Alexa, Pinterest and Google+ require you to verify your domain. This makes sure that you are the correct owner of your blog or store before they provide their services to you. You can use this plugin to easily verify your website or domain and get a more effective and efficient sharing results. Example with Pinterest. Once you completed the verification process, people will see a checkmark next to your domain in your Pinterest profile and in pinner search results. That check mark emphasis you have confirmed the ownership of your blog or website on Pinterest. This will help your website to rank better in google and other search engines.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.org) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. But If your language is not available then you can make one. This plugin is ready for translation. The `.pot` file is included and placed in "`languages`" folder. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you shared your translation with the community. Just send the translation files (`*.po, *.mo`) to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include the translation within the next plugin update.

= Q. How does it work? =
A. First, go to page "`Settings`" —> "`All Meta Tags`".
On the plugin page you find the fields where you can enter your `ID` (meta key "content" value from your verification code), `URL` to the your social network profile or name of your social network profile in order to verify your website.

= Q. How much of description I can enter in the text field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters, but most search engines use a maximum of 160 chars for the home description.

= Q. How much of keywords I can enter in the text field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. What about compatibility with plugin "All in One SEO Pack" ? =
A. To make these plugins compatible you need to stick to one simple rule: do not fill the same field in both plugins at once. Otherwise both plugins fulfill their work and you will get a duplicate actions, for example:
`<head>
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright (c) 2013-2015 Arthur Gareginyan. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2015 Arthur Gareginyan. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
</head>`

In the rest, the "All Meta Tags" and "All in One SEO Pack" is compatible.

= Q. Does this plugin require modification to the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is added/configured entirely from the website's Admin section.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using a simple WordPress settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is that the plugin has a conflict with another plugin you're using. It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Please visit [Dedicated Plugin Page on GitHub](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/all-meta-tags) and report.
