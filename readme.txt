Easily and safely add your custom meta tags to the WordPress website's head section. This is a must have tool for authors and website's owners.


== Description ==

An easy to use, with intuitive interface, WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to easily and safely add your custom meta tags to your WordPress website, directly out of the WordPress Admin Area, without the need to have an external editor.

This is a must have tool for authors and website's owners. Its purpose is to provide a familiar experience to WordPress users. There is no need for any more editing of the files of your theme or plugins for to add custom meta tags. Just add your ID (the meta key "content" value from your verification code) or/and the URL to the social media profile of the publisher in the field on the plugin page and this plugin will do the rest for you. It will automatically add required meta tags to the head section of your website, without changing any of your theme files and without slowing down your website. This is really useful in case of updating theme or plugins, because your meta tags would never be overwritten. Your meta tags will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

The plugin works completely independently of the theme, so you can use it with any theme. The meta tags added via this plugin will be entirely unaffected if you edit the contents of the theme’s files, or even completely change the theme. This is really useful in case of updating theme or plugins, because your custom meta tags would never be overwritten. Your custom meta tags will keep on working, no matter how many times you upgrade or switch your theme and plugins.

Third-party services like Google Webmaster Tools, Alexa, Pinterest and Google+ require you to verify your domain. This makes sure that you are the correct owner of your blog or store before they provide their services to you. You can use this plugin to easily verify your website or domain and get a more effective and efficient sharing results. Example with Pinterest. Once you completed the verification process, people will see a checkmark next to your domain in your Pinterest profile and in pinner search results. That check mark emphasis you have confirmed the ownership of your blog or website on Pinterest. This will help your website to rank better in google and other search engines. You can easily increase your blog traffic using this plugin. "All Meta Tags" is a simple but effective SEO plugin.

Also you can use this plugin to add required meta tags such as Author, Designer, Contact, Copyright and Keywords in everywhere on your website (It adds the required meta tags to the header of all pages on your website) or the meta Description and Keywords only for Static Home Page or the meta Description and Keywords only for Blog Page.

If you want more options, then let us know and we will be happy to add them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. The POT file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Just [send the PO file to us](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and we will include this translation within the next plugin update. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, fill in the required fields and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy the improved SEO of your website. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WordPress Admin Area`" -> "`Settings`" -> "`Meta Tags Inserter`".

= Q. How much of description I can enter in the text field? =
A. We don't limit the number of characters, but most search engines use a maximum of 160 chars for the home description.

= Q. How much of keywords I can enter in the text field? =
A. We don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. I can't get verify my website. What am I doing wrong? =
A. The tag code which Google (or Bing, Yandex, Pinterest, Alexa, Norton, WOT, SpecificFeeds) gives you is confusing as you only have to paste in the serial key number/letters (`1234567890`) and not the whole tag (`<meta name="google-site-verification" content=“1234567890” />`). So just paste that into the relevant field and you will see “Success” message appear within a few seconds.

= Q. What about compatibility with the "All in One SEO Pack" plugin ? =
A. As far as we know, the "All Meta Tags" plugin is compatible with the "All in One SEO Pack" plugin. But to make sure that these plugins do not conflict with each other, you need to follow one simple rule: do not fill the same field in both plugins at once. Otherwise both plugins fulfill their work and you will get a duplicate actions, for example:

`<head>
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright (c) 2013-2018 Space X-Chimp. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
     <meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2018 Space X-Chimp. All Rights Reserved.">
     ...
</head>`

If you find a conflict between the plugins, please let us know and we will definitely release an update of the plugin to fix the issue.

= Q. What about compatibility with the "Yoast SEO" plugin ? =
A. As far as we know, the "All Meta Tags" plugin is compatible with the "Yoast SEO" plugin. But to make sure that these plugins do not conflict with each other, you need to follow one simple rule: do not fill the same field in both plugins at once. Otherwise both plugins fulfill their work and you will get a duplicate actions.

If you find a conflict between the plugins, please let us know and we will definitely release an update of the plugin to fix the issue.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Area of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, we'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Bug reports are very welcome! Please visit [our contact page](https://www.spacexchimp.com/contact.html) and report. Thank you!

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
